# EnchantedFortress

A simple game inspired by Age of Castles. Distribute your population to farming, construction, guard duty and scholarship, survive demon invasion and find the way to banish them forever.

## Story

Dark days are upon your land, twisted people have made a pact with demons, hell gates have been opened and demon kind has started to roam this world. As the time passes more hell gates open and demon army grows stronger and bolder. If they are not stopped the realm will be overrun.

Your scholars speculate if there is a ritual to summon the demons then there must be the one to banish them. Help them perform the ritual and defend them from demons who will try to stop them.

## How to play

Majority of the game revolves around distributing population to following jobs:
* Farming - increases population growth
* Construction - builds city walls
* Guard duty - increases military strength
* Research - efficiency improvements and demon banishment

As the time (turns) passes demon army strength will grow and when they grow confident enough they will mount an attack. The attacks don't come without the warning, your people will report how many demons they saw so when that number gets high enough expect an attack.

When the attack comes all of your population participates in the defense with following effectivness:
* Guards on the wall - 20 (+ soldering bonus)
* Guards on the ground - 10 (+ soldering bonus)
* Civilians on the wall - 4
* Civilians on the ground - 1

Ultimately your success depends on balancing military power and economy. It might be tempting to put as many people as possible to a guard duty but if the attack doesn't come on given turn, farmering would be better choice in the long run. Research is another way to improve your military and economy in the long term. All population participates in research but similar to military strenght not everyone contribute equally. Scholars (people not assigned to farming, construction and guard duty) generate 10 research points while others make only 1 point. Research improves following areas:
* Farming - +1/12 food per farmer (base is 3)
* Construction - +10% construction points
* Soldiering - +10% guard military power
* Research - +12.5% research speed
* Banishment ritual - closes hell gates (less demons spawned per turn) while being researched and ends the game when completed
